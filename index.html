    <h2>Why is keeping food fresh such a struggle?</h2>
    <p>The problem is food spoilage and itâ€™s occurring because people often donâ€™t keep track of their groceries and expiration dates. The root cause is that it's inconvenient and tedious to keep track of when everything in your fridge expires and where everything is. When it's hard to navigate and track your groceries good produce often spoils and goes to waste. It's also hard to put together recipes when you don't believe you have enough ingredients which you may have, you just can't see.</p>
